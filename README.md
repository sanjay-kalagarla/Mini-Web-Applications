# 📦 Mini Web Applications

A compact collection of small web apps built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Each project demonstrates a focussed front-end concept such as DOM manipulation, events, timers, or simple game logic.

## 🚀 Projects Included (with Short Descriptions)

- 🔢 **Counter** — Increase, decrease, and reset a number through button-driven DOM updates.  
- 🎲 **Dice Roller** — Roll a virtual dice using JavaScript’s random number generation.  
- ⏰ **Digital Clock** — Real-time clock that updates every second using the Date API.  
- 🖼️ **Image Slider** — Navigate through images using next/previous controls.  
- 🔍 **Number Guessing Game** — Guess the randomly chosen number with feedback.
